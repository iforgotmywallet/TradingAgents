# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements ChromaDB integration to persistently store and retrieve agent reports from the trading agents system. The system currently has issues loading specific reports from agents, showing "Unable to Load Report" errors. By implementing ChromaDB storage, we can ensure reliable persistence and retrieval of all agent reports, including individual agent analyses and final decisions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trading system user, I want agent reports to be persistently stored in ChromaDB, so that I can reliably access them even after system restarts or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL establish a connection to ChromaDB using cloud client configuration
2. WHEN ChromaDB client is created THEN it SHALL use API key, tenant, and database parameters from environment variables
3. WHEN ChromaDB connection fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages and handle gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a structured data model for storing agent reports, so that each report can be uniquely identified and efficiently retrieved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a data model is created THEN it SHALL include a unique identifier for each analysis session
2. WHEN a data model is created THEN it SHALL include separate columns for each agent type (Market Analyst, News Analyst, Fundamentals Analyst, Social Media Analyst, Bull Researcher, Bear Researcher, Risk Manager, Trader)
3. WHEN a data model is created THEN it SHALL include columns for final decision and final analysis
4. WHEN a data model is created THEN it SHALL include metadata fields like timestamp, stock symbol, and analysis date
5. WHEN storing reports THEN each field SHALL accommodate detailed report content as text

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trading system, I want to automatically save agent reports to ChromaDB when they complete their analysis, so that no reports are lost due to system issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent completes a report THEN the system SHALL automatically save the report to ChromaDB
2. WHEN saving a report THEN it SHALL be associated with the correct unique analysis session ID
3. WHEN saving a report THEN it SHALL update the appropriate agent column in the database
4. WHEN saving fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue operation without crashing
5. WHEN final decision is made THEN it SHALL be saved to the final decision column
6. WHEN final analysis is completed THEN it SHALL be saved to the final analysis column

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web application user, I want to retrieve individual agent reports from ChromaDB, so that I can view detailed analysis even when the original files are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a specific agent report THEN the system SHALL query ChromaDB using the unique session ID
2. WHEN retrieving a report THEN it SHALL return the specific agent's detailed analysis content
3. WHEN a report is not found THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN multiple reports exist for the same session THEN the system SHALL return the most recent version
5. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to file-based retrieval if possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper environment configuration for ChromaDB, so that the system can connect securely to the cloud database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN they SHALL include CHROMADB_API_KEY, CHROMADB_TENANT, and CHROMADB_DATABASE
2. WHEN .env file is updated THEN it SHALL contain the ChromaDB configuration parameters
3. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about required environment variables
4. WHEN using cloud client THEN it SHALL use the specified tenant and database parameters
